# first-multithreaded-app
This is my very first multi-threaded app (created in old fashion way with new Thread object).

Depending on user input (valid value from 2 to 15) in "Threads count" field, this app creates the same counn additional threads. Each thread generates random values.
in addition this app writes generated numbers,threadid,date to mdb file and displays last 20 db record on listview control.
